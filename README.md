•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Designing programs to be maintainable, readable, and adaptable is crucial to the code’s reusability and sustainability as it evolves. Creating code with structure and clarity allows future developers to evolve the program and adapt to industry revelations without causing complications. Programming with these principles treats the program as a long-term investment that has the ability to keep up with the changing requirements in a fast-paced environment. 


•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When faced with a problem as a computer scientist, I first analyze the situation and ensure that I understand the requirements to the best of my ability with the information that has been provided. Once I feel I have collected and distinguished between the functional and non-functional requirements, I begin to make a high-level plan that will guide the implementation process and solve the problem. The Gravioso Salvare project required iterative testing throughout each stage and ensured seamless integration of each  component. Iterative testing is a technique that I use within every project to catch bugs early and before they turn into critical errors. 


•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are trained problem solvers who harness an extensive toolbox of logical, mathematical, and technical skills to efficiently analyze and solve complex challenges. Designing and constructing a database and dashboard for Gravioso Salvare increases the company’s organization and data efficiency. It solves their problem of being able to identify and categorize available dogs that can be trained for Water, Mountain, and Disaster rescues from local animal shelters. Some challenges addressed by computer scientists often yield outcomes that prove to be of greater significance to the world than initially perceived.
